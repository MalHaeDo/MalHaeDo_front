      - assets/images/Onboarding_image_2.png
      - assets/images/Onboarding_image_3.png

      - assets/images/Onboarding_image_5.png
      - assets/images/Onboarding_image_6.png
      - assets/images/Home_image.png
      - assets/images/Writing_image.png
      - assets/images/Throw_bottle.gif
      - assets/images/Throw_reply.gif
      - assets/images/bottle.png
      - assets/images/penguin.svg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
